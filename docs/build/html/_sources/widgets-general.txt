Widgets: Dates, Sliders and Combination Widgets
***********************************************

DateCombo, TitleDateCombo
    These widgets allow a user to select a date.  The actual selection of a date is done with the class MonthBox, which is displayed in a temporary window.  The constructor can be passed the following arguments - `allowPastDate=False` and `allowTodaysDate=False` - both of which will affect what the user is allowed to select. The constructor can also accept the argument `allowClear=True`.

ComboBox, TitleCombo
    This box looks like a Textbox, but the user can only select from a list of options.  Which are displayed in a temporary window if the user wants to change the value.  Like the MultiLine widget, the attribute *value* is the index of a selection in the list *values*.  The ComboBox widget can also be customised by overloading the *display_value(self, vl)* method. 

FilenameCombo, TitleFilenameCombo
    This presents a control for picking filenames.  The following arguments can be passed in to the constructor::
        
        select_dir=False
        must_exist=False
        confirm_if_exists=False
        sort_by_extension=True
        
    These also correspond to attributes on the widget that can be set at any time.
    
    This widget was added in version 2.0pre81.
        


Slider, TitleSlider
   Slider presents a horizontal slider.  The following additional arguments to the constructor are useful:

   out_of=100
      The maximum value of the slider.
   step=1
      The increments by which a user my increase or decrease the value.
   lowest=0
      The minimum value a user can select. Note that sliders are not designed to allow a user to select negative values.  *lowest* should be >= 0
   label=True
      Whether to print a text label next to the slider.  If so, see the *translate_value* method.
      
   All of these options set attributes of the same name that may be altered once the widget exists.
   
   The text displayed next to the widget (if *label=True*) is generated by the *translate_value* method.  This takes no options and returns a string.  It makes sense to subclass the Slider object and overload this method.  It probably makes sense to ensure that the string generated is of a fixed length.  Thus the default code looks like::
   
      stri = "%s / %s" %(self.value, self.out_of)
      l = (len(str(self.out_of)))*2+4
      stri = stri.rjust(l)
      return stri


Widgets: Grids
**************

SimpleGrid
    This offers a spreadsheet-like display.  The default is only intended to display information (in a grid of text-fields).  However, it is designed to be flexible and easy to customize to display a variety of different data.  Future versions may include new types of grids.  Note that you can control the look of the grid by specifying either *columns* or *column_width* at the time the widget is created.  It may be that in the future the other multi-line classes will be derived from this class.

    The cursor location is specified in the attribute *.edit_cell*.  Note that this follows the (odd) curses convention of specifying the row, then the column.

    *values* should be specified as a two-dimensional array.
    
    The convenience function *set_grid_values_from_flat_list(new_values, max_cols=None, reset_cursor=True) takes a flat list and displays it on the grid.
    
    The following arguments can be passed to the constructor::
                
        columns = None
        column_width = None, 
        col_margin=1, 
        row_height = 1, 
        values = None
        always_show_cursor = False
    
    Classes derived from SimpleGrid may wish to modify the following class attributes::
    
        _contained_widgets    = textbox.Textfield
        default_column_number = 4  
        additional_y_offset   = 0  # additional offset to leave within the widget before the grid 
        additional_x_offset   = 0  # additional offset to leave within the widget before the grid
    
    

GridColTitles
    Like the simple grid, but uses the first two lines of the display to display the column titles.  These can be provided as a *col_titles* argument at the time of construction, or by setting the *col_titles* attribute at any time.  In either case, provide a list of strings.


Widgets: Other Controls
***********************

Checkbox, RoundCheckBox
   These offer a single option - the label is generated from the attribute *name*, as for titled widgets.  The attribute *value* is either true or false.
   
   The function whenToggled(self) is called when the user toggles the state of the checkbox.  You can overload it.
   
CheckBoxMultiline, RoundCheckBoxMultiline
	This widgets allow the label of the checkbox to be more than one line long.  The name of the widget should be specified as a
	list or tuple of strings.
	
	To use these widgets as part of a multiline widget, do the following::
	
		class MultiSelectWidgetOfSomeKind(npyscreen.MultiSelect):
		    _contained_widgets = npyscreen.CheckBoxMultiline
		    _contained_widget_height = 2
    
		    def display_value(self, vl):
		        # this function should return a list of strings.
	
	
	New in version 2.0pre83.


Button
   Functionally similar to the Checkbox widgets, but looking different.  The Button is usually used for OK and Cancel Buttons on Forms and similar things, though they should probably be replaced with the ButtonPress type.
   
ButtonPress
    Not a toggle, but a control.  This widget has the method whenPressed(self), which you should overload to do your own things.
   
FormControlCheckbox
   A common use of Checkbox is to offer the user the option to enter additional data.  For example "Enter Expiry Date".  In such a case, the Form needs to display additional fields in some cases, but not in others.  FormControlCheckbox makes this trivial.
   
   Two methods are defined:
   
   addVisibleWhenSelected(*wg*)
      *wg* should be a widget.  
      
      This method does not create a widget, but instead puts an existing widget under the control of the FormControlCheckbox.  If FormControlCheckbox is selected, the widget will be visible.  
      
      As many widgets as you wish can be added in this way.
      
   addInvisibleWhenSelected(*wg*)
      Widgets registered in this way are visible only when the FormControlCheckbox is not selected.
      
AnnotateTextboxBase, TreeLineAnnotated, TreeLineSelectableAnnotated
    The *AnnotateTextboxBase* class is mainly intended for use by the
    multiline listing widgets, for situations where each item displayed needs an
    annotation supplied to the left of the entry itself.  The API for these
    classes is slightly ugly, because these classes were originally intended for
    internal use only.  It is likely that more user-friendly versions will be
    supplied in a later release.  Classes derived from *AnnotateTextboxBase*
    should define the following:

    *ANNOTATE_WIDTH*
        This class attribute defines how much margin to leave before the
        text entry widget itself.  In the TreeLineAnnotated class the margin needed is calculated
        dynamically, and ANNOTATE_WIDTH is not needed.

    *getAnnotationAndColor* 
        This function should return a tuple consisting of the string to
        display as the annotation and the name of the colour to use when displaying
        it.  The colour will be ignored on B/W displays, but should be provided in
        all cases, and the string should not be longer than *ANNOTATE_WIDTH*,
        although by default the class does not check this.

    *annotationColor*, *annotationNoColor*
        These methods draw the annotation on the screen.  If using strings
        only, these should not need overriding.  If one is altered, the other should
        be too, since npyscreen will use one if the display is configured for colour
        and the other if configured for black and white.
