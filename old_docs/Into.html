<H2>Purpose</H2>

<p>NPYScreen is a library for python.  It is designed to make the writing of curses-based user-interfaces quick and painless.  

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>NPYScreen is packaged using the standard python tools.  You can type:

<code>python setup.py install</code>

to install.  Version 2.5 or higher of python is required.

<h2>Basic use</h2>

<h3>Importing</h3>

<p>Import the module with the line:

<code>import npyscreen</code>

<h3>Basic Object Types</h3>
<p>The library defines three basic kinds of object.

<dl>
<dt>Widget Objects</dt>
 <dd>This is the most numerous class: text fields, lists, date fields, and so on and so forth.</dd>
<dt>Form Objects</dt>
 <dd>Forms are the containers for widgets.  An application will have at least one form.  Some forms also provide additional facilities, such as menus.</dd>
<dt>NPSApplication Objects</dt>
 <dd>While you can program using npyscreen without using npsapplication objects, these provide an additional level of abstraction, and are the easiest way to use the library.</dd>
</dl>
