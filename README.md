Hopefully the name gives it away, but this is NOT the main project page for npyscreen!

That would be located here: https://code.google.com/p/npyscreen/

npyscreen is primarily (as I understand it) the brain-child of Nicholas Cole, much thanks
to them and others for the development of this interesting tool!

What's the deal with nypscreen-restructure?

I really couldn't think of a better name, also I am not really necessarily trying to create
a splinter fork. Maybe if I accomplish anything worthwhile then it will be folded back
into the primary project.

I have some interesting ideas for creating a fairly advanced terminal UI project, and I am
considering whether or not it might be accomplished with npyscreen. But to be quite honest
(respectfully), npyscreen is not well organized and much could be improved by a concerted
effort to restructure and refactor.

The near-term goal is to restructure/refactor and amend inconsistencies and get it working
again more or less as it was (albeit with a significantly altered API). There are a few
practices I may change along the way. Mid to long-term, hopefully I'll be able to
contribute some more advanced scientific-focused widgets and develop some "live instrumentation"
style interface stuff.

If you are interested in this project, please get in touch!
